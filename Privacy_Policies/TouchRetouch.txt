It doesnât matter whether you have become a client or whether there is a contract between us or not, this document is intended to ensure transparency in the use of your personal data.                                                                ADVA Soft takes your privacy seriously. When you use our apps or website, you provide some information identifying you. It is important that you know what information we collect, how we do that, and how we utilize it. This document was designed to explain that.                                                        1. Responsible Party                                                            ADVA Soft GmbH (registration information can be found under the âImprintâ section at the end of this document or on our website) is legally responsible for protecting your personal data. In case of any questions or complaints, you can contact us at support at adva-soft.com anytime.                                                        2. Purpose of Storage                                                            When you create a user account or enter into a contract with us as a customer, the account linked to your account is created in our system. It incorporates the data provided by you, information about your order, and, if necessary, your billing information ("Customer Information"). We store and process this data because otherwise we wonât be able to fulfill our contractual obligations.                            Website                                The moment you start navigating our website, your computer provides us with your IP address and, depending on what you do and what your computer settings are, we start storing small text files on your hard drive ("cookies"). These files help us improve your user experience on our website. It's a kind of short-term memory of your browser.                                                                Text files ("log files") are also created in our system. They may contain the following information about you: the model of your computer and the type of its operating system, your browser type and version, the URL of the web page you are coming from, and the time. Log files can not be assigned to specific persons. We do not try to link this data to cookies or IP addresses. However, we reserve the right to retrospectively evaluate log files in individual cases if we become aware of concrete indications for their unlawful use. Log files help us understand what types of computers our website should support and when a lot of (or few) people use it. Based on this information, we can adjust our web pages structure, servers, and database systems to better meet the needs of our customers.                            Social media plug-ins                                We currently use social media plug-ins provided by Facebook and Twitter. When you visit our website, no personal data is passed on to these providers. You can easily recognize a provider by its logo on the respective button and interact directly with it via that button. The moment you click the button, the plug-in provider starts receiving the information about the website you came from. By activating the plug-in, you give its provider access to your personal data (for plug-in providers in the USA) (in the case of Facebook in Germany, IP addresses are anonymized immediately after data collection). Since plug-in providers collect data mainly via cookies, we recommend that you delete all the cookies in the security settings of your browser.                                                                We have no influence on data processing operations, nor are we aware of the full extent of data collection, purpose of processing, and retention periods. We also cannot delete the data collected by a plug-in provider.                                                                A plug-in provider stores the data gathered about you as user profiles and utilizes them for the purposes of advertising, market research, and/or tailor-made website design. That is done (also for non-logged in users) to provide needs-based advertising and to you inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the user profiles information being used by contacting a plug-in provider.                                                                We, from our side, use plug-ins to interact with social networks and other users so that we can improve our offers to make them more interesting for you as our customer. Article 6 (1) (f) of the DSGVO serves as the legal basis for the use of plug-ins.                                                                Your personal data transfer takes place depending on whether you have an account with a plug-in provider and are logged in there or not. If you are logged in, the data collected while you have been using our website will be assigned to your existing plug-in account. If you click the plug-in button and, for example, link to the providerâs page, this information will be stored in your user account and shared with your contacts publicly. Thatâs why we recommend that you log out the social network regularly, especially after using the plug-in, as this will prevent your personal data from being transferred to the plug-in provider.                                                                Below you could find privacy statements of the Facebook and Twitter plug-in providers, including their addresses and privacy notices URLs, explaining in detail how they collect and process data. Moreover, youâll get information on your rights and privacy protection settings options.                            Facebook plug-ins (Like button)                                Facebook (Facebook Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California, 94025, USA) plug-ins are integrated in our website. They can be recognized by the Facebook logo or "Like" inscription. For more details on Facebook plug-ins, please follow the link: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. Facebook plug-ins provide a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server. Facebook finds out that you have visited our website through your IP address. The moment you click the âLikeâ button, while being logged in your Facebook account, the contents of our pages become linked to your Facebook profile. As a result, Facebook can assign the information about your actions on our website to your user account.                                                                We must indicate that we are not aware of what content exactly is transferred and how Facebook uses it. For more information, please check the Facebookâs privacy policy at http://de-de.facebook.com/policy.php. If you do not wish Facebook to associate your actions on our website with your Facebook user account, please log out your Facebook account.                                                                More information on data collection by Facebook:                                http://www.facebook.com/help/186325668085084http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-other#applications                                Facebook is an active EU-US Privacy Shield Framework participant:                                https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-FrameworkTwitter                                Twitter (Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA) plug-ins are also integrated in our website. By using Twitter and the Retweet function, you link your actions on our website to your Twitter account and share them with other users. This data is also passed on to Twitter. We must indicate that we are not aware of what content exactly is transferred and how Twitter uses it.                                                                You can change your Twitter account privacy settings at twitter.com/account/settings (https://twitter.com/privacy).

We use this technical data to fully investigate the problems you report in order to reproduce and solve them as soon as possible. We reserve the right to ask for further details should we need more information. We can do that by sending requests to your email address. Email communication is the most effective way to respond to your needs.                                                                You also voluntarily send us many useful suggestions and recommendations to improve our apps. We appreciate your doing so, as your ideas help us perfect our apps so that they better serve your needs. We store your feedback, altogether with your email addresses, in our Suggestions database to implement the features you are interested in in due course. When those requested features are added to our apps, we do our best to inform you about that as soon as possible.                                                                When investigating the problems you report, we sometimes ask you to send us your original photos as well as some screenshots or videos illustrating what is wrong with one of our apps. Thanks to them, we get a more comprehensive idea of what is going on and at the same time obtain the object for testing. We keep this data for some time to have it accessible in case you inform us that the same issues start reproducing again. We would like to assure you that the multimedia you provide for that purpose is used only by those team members who are responsible for reproducing and solving the problems and is stored temporarily. It is not shared to anybody else. We keep it safe and secure.                            Personal information shared through social networks                                We may get access to some kind of personal information you reveal when you share your photos to social networks through our apps, including, but not limited to, your name, place of birth, place of work, address, and your photo gallery. However, we donât do that. We neither collect this information, nor use it in any other way.                            Location information (iOS apps)                                The moment you allow our apps to access your photo albums, you allow them to access the EXIF data attached to your photos. Moreover, if the Location Services option is turned on on your device, you automatically make it possible for the apps to determine and track the precise real-time location of the device you are using. Though accessible, this personal data is neither used nor shared.                                                        3. Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties                                                            When processing your data, we use some programs and services provided by other companies ("tools"). We change the tools from time to time if that makes sense for legal, technical, or economic reasons.                                                                We currently use the following tools for data administration and provision (in particular, IP addresses, cookies, and log files):                                * Google Analytics (website traffic measurement)* Datev (administration of master data, accounting)* Flurry Analytics (analysis and measurement of the activity in apps).* Quip (support)                                If you deny the permission to use these tools, we wonât be able to fulfill our contractual obligations and will have to offer you the solutions that would be less effective.                                                            To carry out software development and provide support, we cooperate with service providers located in Ukraine. Your data therefore can be transferred to Ukraine and stored there on the servers of ADVASoft GmbH. There are contracts between the responsible party and these service providers, regulating rights, obligations, and personal data protection measures. Data transfer to any other providers or storage locations in other countries outside the European Union does not take place.                                                        4. Deletion Deadlines                            We retain your data until your order is completed or the legal retention period has expired. For more information on storage of business documents, please see Section 257 HGB.                            5. Information                            You have the legal right to request information about the data stored by us whenever needed. If, despite our effort to maintain accurate and up to date, we keep some incorrect details about you, we will correct them as soon as possible at your request. If the data processing is based on your consent, you can withdraw this consent at any time.                            6. Supervisory Authority                            If you believe that we are not fulfilling our obligations to you, you have the right to complain about that to a supervisory authority (for example, to a state data protection officer).                            7. Voluntary Data Sharing                            You are not obliged to share your personal data with us and therefore you can refuse the storage of your IP address. However, we would like to note that for the execution of the contact between you and us, the processing of your data as described above is necessary. If you revoke your consent to your personal data processing, we wonât be able to provide the best service possible to you, while you will have to keep fulfilling your obligations (your data will be stored in the above-mentioned management systems until the termination of the contract).                            8. Change of Purpose                            If we intend to process your data for a purpose other than that for which you gave it to us, we will inform you of that purpose and provide the reason for that. You can revoke your consent to further data processing at any time.
